# SCIENTIFIC ABSTRACT

## Project Title
Arduino-Based Water Leak Detection and Alert System with Trend Analysis

## Authors
[Your Name] - Electronic/Environmental Engineering

## Location
Mozambique, 2024

## Problem Statement
Water leaks cause significant property damage, resource waste, and mold growth, especially in developing regions like Mozambique where water conservation is critical.

## Solution
An affordable, multi-sensor system that detects water leaks, monitors water levels, and alerts users through visual and auditory signals with data logging capabilities.

## Technical Innovation
1. **Multi-sensor integration**: Water detection, movement sensing, and ultrasonic level monitoring
2. **Smart alert system**: Color-coded LED indicators with severity-based responses
3. **Data logging**: CSV format for trend analysis and preventive maintenance
4. **Debounce algorithms**: Minimizes false positives from sensor noise

## Key Features
- Real-time water leak detection (response time <200ms)
- Movement/vibration monitoring for pipe integrity
- Optional water level tracking with ultrasonic sensor
- Comprehensive CSV data logging
- Visual (RGB LED) and auditory (buzzer) alerts

## Applications
- Residential water leak prevention
- Commercial building monitoring
- Industrial equipment protection
- Agricultural water management

## Impact in Mozambique
- Reduces water waste in drought-prone regions
- Prevents property damage in flood-vulnerable areas
- Promotes water conservation awareness
- Demonstrates affordable environmental technology
